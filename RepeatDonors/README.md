## Failed Project Idea -- Identify Repeat Donors

My goal with these files, in the first week of the project, was to generate a model that could identify which first-time donors would go on to donate a second time.

This project was scrapped after I realized there were not enough features in the data to differentiate between donors.

I learned a lot about the dataset and how to properly query it via SQL from this initial work.
